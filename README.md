# Sublimation

This repository contains a very lightweight Rust crate designed to use the Steam API.

Currently only targets Windows.

This is still a work in progress.

## Steam Redistributables

You'll need to supply your own.  If you own a single Steam game (there are free to play games), or have SteamWorks access, you have a copy.
