# Sublimation

*This is still a work in progress.*

This repository contains a very lightweight Rust crate designed to use the Steam API.

Currently only targets Windows.

## Steam Redistributables

You'll need to supply your own.  If you own a single Steam game (there are free to play games), or have SteamWorks access, you have a copy.

At some stage I'll do something clever to mitigate this, but for now this is designed to be quick and dirty for the projects I've been doing.
